# 🏡 House Price Prediction 

## 👋 Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, location, and more using machine learning techniques. Accurate price prediction helps in real estate investment decisions and market analysis.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on housing data
- Preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features
- Build and evaluate multiple regression models
- Optimize model accuracy using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset includes features such as:
- `Location`
- `Area` (square feet)
- `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`
- `Balconies`
- `Price`

> *(Dataset source: [ it’s from Kaggle]*)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Train-Test Split, Cross-Validation)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution of prices and areas
- Correlation heatmap
- Price vs. number of rooms and location
- Outlier detection and removal

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Trained and evaluated the following regression models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**

### ✅ Model Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

---

## 🧪 Results & Insights
- Identified key predictors of price: area, location, number of rooms
- Ridge regression showed better generalization due to regularization
- Achieved [insert R² score or accuracy metric] on the test set

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add location-based encoding for better accuracy
- Use advanced models like XGBoost or Random Forest
- Integrate with a frontend UI for real-time prediction
